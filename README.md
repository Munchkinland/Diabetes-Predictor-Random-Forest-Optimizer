# Diabetes Prediction Random Forest Optimization

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a Random Forest classifier, with an emphasis on optimizing the model parameters for better performance.

# Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Use the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
Follow these steps to train the model and make predictions:

Run the data ingestion section to load the dataset.
Initialize and train the model with the provided parameters.
Visualize the decision trees generated by the model.
Predict outcomes using the trained model.
Save the trained model to a file.

# Visualizing Decision Trees

The generated decision trees provide insight into the inner workings of the Random Forest model. The `tree.png` file showcases the structure of the first four trees in the ensemble.

# Model Performance

The model's accuracy is evaluated using the accuracy score, which measures the proportion of correctly predicted outcomes. A higher accuracy score indicates better model performance.
